## About The Project

<div align="center">

</div>

One of the important urban and envirnomental planning metrics is the ambient temperature which correlates to thermal comfort. However we cannot have a accurate sensing of the ambient temperature because of the sparse ambient temperature sensors installed in Singapore. 

We turn to USGS Landsat 8 satellite images to generate Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps. LST is the radiative skin temperature of the land derived from solar radiation. We use LST as a proxy to ambient temperature.

In this repository, you will find the scripts required to download, generate and stack LST maps. 

## Built With

* [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)
* [R Studio](https://posit.co/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

###### Python Packages (in Conda)
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
###### R Packages (in R Studio)
|   |   |
|---|---|
| maptools     | rlist      |
| raster       | rstudioapi |
| RColorBrewer | sp         |
| rgdal        |            |
```
install.packages(c("maptools", "raster", "RColorBrewer", "rgdal", "rlist", "rstudioapi", "sp"))
```

### Installation

1. Register for an EarthExplorer account [here.](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/register)
